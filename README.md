## Stolen Card Fraud: The most common. A fraudster uses a stolen credit card to donate. The real owner disputes the charge, leading to a chargeback.

## Money Laundering: Using donations to "clean" illegally obtained money (less common for small donations, but possible).

## Fake Campaigns: Creating a charitable campaign for a non-existent cause.

## Focus: For this project, we'll focus on detecting fraudulent donations (stolen cards) to legitimate campaigns. This is a well-scoped, classic problem.
